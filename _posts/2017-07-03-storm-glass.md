I suppose this is my first official post on this blog. I’m struggling over whether to just stick to pen and paper diary for these “blog posts”, but the advantage of search-ability of a digital format is just too attractive. There’s also the questions of whether or not I should publish it online or not. Having a footprint on the internet can be a fantastic way to share information and to start some kind of portfolio. One way to do it would be through github pages which will ensure that my blog will always be online. 

Over the weekend I started an experiment to make storm glasses with the following recipe I found online:

- 2.5g potassium nitrate
- 2.5g ammonium chloride
- 33 mL distilled water
- 40 mL ethanol
- 10g camphor

( insert some pictures here! )
