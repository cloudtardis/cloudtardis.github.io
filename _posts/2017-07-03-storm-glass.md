Over the weekend I started an experiment to make storm glasses with the a recipe I found online...

## Storm Glass Recipe

- 2.5g potassium nitrate
- 2.5g ammonium chloride
- 33 mL distilled water
- 40 mL ethanol
- 10g camphor


( insert some pictures here! )


While the formula worked really well, some people are are claiming that Potassium Nitrate and Ammonium Chloride don't actually do anything. I intend on finding out. It should also be noted that the tendency for the Camphor crystals to form at a given room temperature is very sensitive to the ethanol to distilled water ratio. Pure ethanol will disolve the crystals completely while pure distilled water will result in camphor staying in the crystal form.


## Things to try:

- What would happen if we introduce a spinning capsule, thus inducing a swirl in the solution? How would the crystals move under moving water and what kind of crystal formation can we expect? 
- What if we manipulate the temperature distribution within the solution body, thus controlling the rate of crystal formation on a local scale? We can potentially grow crystals on shapes.
- Carbonated water seemed to have an interesting effect while the carbon dioxide was escaping from the bottom of the container.
