This is Stan's personal blog that's not actually exposed to the harshness of the outside world. Doing so allows the blog to be more personal and less filtered.

The blog will act as a central repository for diary entires, thoughts, essays, photographies, stories and experiments etc. Over time, the layout of this blog will improve (hopefully significantly). I want everything to by organised under:

- date
- title
- category
- tags
- content
